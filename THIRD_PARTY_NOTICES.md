# Third-party notices

Original GradBefore code has no license grant in this repository. These notices apply only to the identified dependencies.

Runtime: saxes 6.0.0 (ISC and inherited notices), xmlchars 2.2.0 (MIT). Dependency code is installed from the locked registry packages and is not vendored in this source candidate.

Native/test-only tools: Synfig 1.5.5 (GPL-2.0-or-later), Inkscape and its SIF exporter (GPL), svgcleaner 0.9.5 (GPL-2.0), Scour 0.38.2 (Apache-2.0), SVGO 4.0.0 (MIT), Playwright 1.55.1 (Apache-2.0), Pillow and the Ubuntu display tools are fetched/installed externally for synthetic tests. No application, browser or optimizer binary/source bundle is included in the original-source archive or native evidence. These test tools do not grant a license to the original project code.

Ubuntu's libarchive-tools is also a test-only archive reader. Its upstream [COPYING](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/blob/v3.6.0/COPYING) describes the main BSD two-clause terms and per-file exceptions. Neither its executable nor source is included here.

The following license is the one that governed sax, from which saxes
was forked. Isaac Schlueter is not *directly* involved with saxes so
don't go bugging him for saxes issues.
